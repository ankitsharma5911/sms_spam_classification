# sms_spam_detection

to detect spam messages in SMS, we can use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning techniques. Here's a basic approach:
### Step 1: Data Collection
Collect a dataset of SMS messages, both spam and non-spam. You can use publicly available datasets
or create your own.
### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the text data by:
* Tokenizing the text into individual words or phrases
* Removing stop words (common words like "the", "and", etc.)
* Lemmatizing words to their base form
* Vectorizing the text data using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF
### Step 3: Feature Engineering
Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data, such as:
* Word frequencies
* N-gram frequencies
* Part-of-speech (POS) tags
* Named entity recognition (NER)
### Step 4: Model Selection and Training
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as:
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Train the model using the preprocessed data and features.
### Step 5: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics like
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
### Step 6: Model Deployment
Deploy the trained model in a production-ready environment, such as a web API or a mobile app.
### Example Code
Here's a simple example using Python and the scikit-learn library:
